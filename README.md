This social media application is a platform for event planning and event sharing between friends and/or the local community. Users can create events and share them with their followers or open the event up to the local community. Currently events contain a title, description, location, and a time. Users can join or request to join an event to let the host know of their attendance. Users can find events either through posted events from their friends, or by seeing public events across the community.

# Requirements

As part of Project 2, I challenged myself to complete many features of the application that I either hadn't completed or wanted to implement. The requirements I set for myself were:

1.  Finish UD of CRUD.
2.	Add tags to events so users can categorize their events based on categories (sports, music, games…) - Many to many relationships. Users can also have tags in their profile so events with the same tags can be recommended in the explore page.
3.	Implement location services to get the users current location to be able to view public events nearby.
4.	Create functionality for following users and add way to see followers and following on a user’s profile.
5.	Be able to filter events based on tags, location, and friends.
6.	Create an event chat room. When a user joins an event, they are added to a chatroom where attendees can communicate details, coordinate rides, share pictures, and meet the host and other attendees.
7.	Implement notification for new events or chatroom messages.
8.	Create a loading screen with animations.

Aidan Napier - Roommate

The app looked great! It was super easy to create an account and get going. It was also really easy to schedule and customize an event. When adding tags, it would be helpful to have an exit button. I had a great experience and it was super easy to navigate wherever I wanted to go. 

# Grading

Personly this project was a real challenge for me. I knew the requirements I wanted to inlcude but had no idea if I was able to implement them all within the timeframe. I'm proud to say I was able to complete all of them except for the notifications and loading animations. For notifications I would have had to purchase the developer account which I will eventually, but not right now. The loading animation was something I thought would be fun, but in order to complete it I have to rework how I load data from Firebase and would have to pay extra for more functionality.

I feel like I completed the project to my best ability without having to spend more. I put in countless hours throughout the past couple weeks to build an application that I am truly proud of. It's not entirely finished, so you'll run into area that take you no where quite yet. I've had so much fun and am excited to keep working on it.

Definitely A grade work.
